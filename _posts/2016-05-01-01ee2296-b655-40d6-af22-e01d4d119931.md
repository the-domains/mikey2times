2.5 years in shop experience. Apprenticed under famed tattoo'er, Damon Conklin at Super Genius Tattoo in Seattle, WA. Studied under Zez as a tattoo'er at Emporium of Design in Denver, Colorado. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3a80aca7-ceea-4fbe-9a00-0d62b9d8eacf.jpg)

Experience with traditional and new age style of tattooing and flash art. I have most recently been tattooing a lot of traditional, custom mandalas and trash polka.
